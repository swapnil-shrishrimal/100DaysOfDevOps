One shell script is placed under /tmp/ folder or remote machine. However, the script does not have executable permission yet. Task is to provide executable permission such that all users can execute the script.
  a. Login into remote server using below command. Once prompted for password, provide required password for login.
      ssh username@hostname OR
      ssh username@ip_address
  b. Change directory to where the script is located. In this case it is "/tmp"
      cd /tmp/
  c. Check for existing permission on the file by using ls command. In this case name of shell script is xfusioncorp.sh
      ls -lart
  d. Now to have executable permission through shell we need to have read and execute permission on file. We can provide permission using below command
      sudo chmod 555 xfusioncorp.sh
  e. The above command will provide required executable permissio to the shell script. You can verify it by executing shell script by different users.
      ./xfusioncorp.sh
